# Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning 2.0 (2024 Revamp)

Just revamped for 2024, this course is for both beginners that want to learn HTML/CSS beginning to end as well as seasoned developers that just want to build some cool projects. This is my most important course because it is the entry point to everything else that I have created. Whether you want to build front-end applications with React or full stack Node.js, PHP, Python, etc, you will always need use HTML and CSS in some way.

We go over all kinds of HTML tags, elements and structure and tons of CSS properties and concepts with a sandbox environment. Outside of these learning modules are mini-projects, challenges and 3 main website projects. One project uses the BEM CSS methodology.

The first few sections are tailored for beginners so even if you have never built anything before, you will learn all of the basics. If you already have experience with basic HTML & CSS, you can skip around and learn what you need or just go right into the projects.
